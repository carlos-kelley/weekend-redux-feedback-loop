# Redux Feedback Loop

### UPDATE SCORES

Allow the user to go back to a previous step and change their score. You still need to disallow empty values!

### STYLING

Improve the styling of the app using Material-UI. This might include cards, snackbars, buttons, a nav bar, icons, and/or a theme.

### ADMIN SECTION

- Display all of the existing feedback at the route `/admin`. The most recently added feedback should appear at the top of the list. Allow the user to delete existing feedback. Prompt the user to confirm prior to deleting the feedback from the database.

- Add the ability to flag an existing feedback entry for further review on the /admin view.

### DEPLOY

Deploy your project to Heroku. You'll need to read the special instructions for building and deploying with React.
